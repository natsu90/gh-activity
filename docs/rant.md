### AngularJS 2 to VueJS

Boilerplate is too complex for beginner, plus read somewhere that Angular is overkill if you are developing a single page app.

### CSV Parser to LOAD INFILE

Slow because do read and INSERT for each row. Later found out about LOAD INFILE.

### MySQL to MariaDB

Have problem to parse unicode char. There is something called utf8mb4.

### InnoDB to MyISAM

Slow while INSERT. Plus I don't need ACID, no foreign key, and only need fast SELECT and INSERT.

### Server to Client (GitHub API Limit)

After days of hardwork only to find out the API limit is per account, not token.

### VueJS Starter
